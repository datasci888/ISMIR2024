## Raga Fine-tuned MusicGen Inference
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for generating Raga melodies using a fine-tuned MusicGen model. The notebook is intended to be run on Google Colab and requires access to a Google Drive containing the fine-tuned MusicGen checkpoint.

To use the inference notebook to generate song:

- Open the notebook in Google Colab.
- Mount your Google Drive to provide access to the fine-tuned MusicGen checkpoint.
- Follow the instructions within the inference notebook to load the MusicGen model and generate Raga melodies using textual prompts.
- The generated audio can be played directly in the notebook and saved to your Google Drive or local machine for further use.
